  Principles of Pain

This page concisely outlines contextual information on how pain works. It does so primarily from the perspectives of computational cognitive science and evolutionary biology.

  Pain is not a measure of damage
  #

Most of us naively equate pain with tissue damage. The most common view is that pain is the body&rsquo;s perception of damage.

  \[ \text{or} \]



  \[ \text{Tissue damage} \implies \text{Pain} \]

They can then attempt try to fix these abnormalities via surgery or, failing that, give you painkillers to manage the pain.</p><p>Unfortunately, this model is too simple. Pain does not strictly imply damage:</p><p><strong>Many people have damage without pain.</strong>
Most pain-free people have spinal, hip, shoulder, and knee abnormalities.</p><p>In a famous 1994 study, MC Jensen et al. examined the MRI images of the backs of 98 pain-free people. Of the participants, aged twenty and older, <em>over half had an abnormality (&ldquo;damage&rdquo;) in at least one disk</em><sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>. Herniation or disk bulges were strikingly common in patients who were pain free. There are many other studies demonstrating the frequency of the “spinal abnormalities” that are often used to explain back pain.</p><p>Studies have demonstrated similar findings for labral tears in hips, scarred rotator cuffs, knees without cartilage. Repeatedly we have seen people with major structural musculoskeletal damage be entirely pain free.</p><ul><li>96% of athletes younger than 22 will show changes on
an MRI that some people call “abnormal”. But since
everyone has them how “abnormal” can they be?
(Rajaswaran 2014)
• 37% of 20 year olds with NO PAIN have disc
degeneration in their spine (Brinjikji 2015)
• 57% of 20-50 year olds with no hip pain will have
cartilidge and ligament tears (Tresch 2016)</li></ul><p><strong>Many people have pain without damage.</strong></p><p>People without limbs report major pain in the limb that is missing</p><p>In other words: the typical mistake is to treat pain as purely a hardware problem. What is now very clear is that it is also a software problem.

<a class=anchor href=#pain-is-a-generated-signal-for-protective-action>#</a></h2><p><em>How did pain evolve?</em></p><p>The first pain circuit evolved 600 million years ago, in our ancestor — the bilateral worm. It was a protective instinct responding to external stimuli. If poked, the worm would retreat.</p><p>There were no feelings of unpleasant pain, only instinctive movement. Only far later, as our limbic system developed, did internal sensations like fear and pain arise. The unpleasantness we associate with pain is a later evolutionary module.</p><p><strong>The purpose of pain is to get you to act</strong>.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re cooking later today, and accidently touch a burning stove. What do you do? You whip your hand away from the stove. You might cool it down under running water, and then you&rsquo;ll keep it close to your body. These are all protective actions.</p><p>All this is to say that, rather than a measure of damage, pain is a signal your body generates as a prompt to &ldquo;move to safety&rdquo;.</p><p><em>How is pain generated?</em></p><p>As with all signals that our body generates, it is heavily informed by past experience.</p><p>You can naively think about our experience as an integration of sensory stimuli and our expectations.</p><p>[Graph of pain expectation]</p><h2 id=most-chronic-pain-arises-from-a-miscalibrated-pain-signal>Most chronic pain arises from a miscalibrated pain signal

In my personal experience, even at the medical department of my elite university, my doctor was not able to explain what was happening with my pain. Many other people I work with have had the same experience. This is a sad reflection on the feedback loops in the western medical system. New research takes a long time to diffuse into the world. The median you&rsquo;ll come across in 2024 finished their training in the late 90s.
