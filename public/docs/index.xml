&lt;p>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Max Shen, the creator of DebugYourPain.org.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I built this site because it took me hundreds of hours of careful searching to find the information that helped me resolve my chronic pain. This site is what I wish I had at the start of my experience with pain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve got two degrees from MIT and have worked at both &lt;a href="https://cushmanlab.fas.harvard.edu/">Moral Psychology Research Lab&lt;/a> at Harvard, and the &lt;a href="https://cocosci.mit.edu/">Computational Cognitive Science Lab&lt;/a> at MIT. After experiencing extensive chronic pain during my graduate program, my focus shifted to understanding and ultimately resolving my pain.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
