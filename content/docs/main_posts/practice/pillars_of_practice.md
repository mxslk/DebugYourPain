# Pain Debugging Protocol

*A broad protocol for pain resolution*

---

 so you've read the principles of pain and you're curious about putting it into action. Before beginning, you might reasonably wonder "is my pain related to some type of structural tissue damage?" The most reliable way is to first go to a professional healthcare practitioner and hear their diagnosis and suggest a treatment, then you might want to read this doc to hear about factors common to what is often called neuroplastic pain

 Expectations.
Expectations.
It's crucial to understand some things about humans. We are not machines – you don't just "fix" apart. We are complex systems with nonlinear Dynamics. A small shift me, and deuce huge change in some people mediately, while it may not work for another person. You are the architect of your own experience. Rather than seeking a magical healer/device/practice, it's very helpful to assume agency and get empirical about what doesn't work for you.

Having said that, it is fortunate that there is clinical evidence about the yeah average timelines for recovery. 

Pain is a signal within a [complex system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system), and there are many factors at different levels of abstraction that can significantly affect the experience of pain. This could include anything from the lingering memory of a back injury to how angry you get at yourself for not being more productive to the presence of toxic mold in your basement.

Debugging pain is not unlike other forms of debugging[^1]. You need to adopt a patient and curious mindset. You need to understand the architecture of the system (i.e. your own principles of pain). You need to tinker, sometimes randomly, and pay close attention to how the system responds.

This protocol does not aim to be comprehensive. Rather, it identifies a few common leverage points that yield results.



(It is worth mentioning that there are some practices especially designed for working with chronic pain. The following protocol is intended to augment those, which we refer to below.)

### 0. Rule out acute interventions

The majority of chronic pain is not the result of structural tissue damage. 

Other things to consider are environmental contaminants. Data on these are poor, but there are groups of people who have reported a wide range of health problems related to environmental toxins. 


### 1. Adopt debugging mindset

- Your goal is to resolve the pain, not necessarily to find the root cause
- 
- Be pragmatically open-minded. The scientific community has a generally poor understanding of how various systems interact in the human body [Nutrition science is pre-paradigmatic, we don't really understand the immune system and how it interacts with the brain, etc]. 
- Experiment broadly, minimizing cost. One common failure mode is to dismiss a low-cost 'woo' technique or practice in favor of the costly 'scientific' approach. Being pragmatically open-minded may mean trying "tapping for emotional release" for a half hour before agreeing to a $10,000 surgery.

- Be kind to yourself. 

- Set up your environment to support your activity. Ergonomics can help, as can screen breaks.

- It may take a long time. It may be very rapid. Our expectations about what does and doesn't work often heavily mediate our experience. Individual pain resolution is difficult to predict, so being open to rapid change while not expecting it is a very helpful stance to have.


### 1. Understand pain

How we understand pain greatly affects how we percieve it. Coming to better grasp the dynamics of pain alone can significantly change your experience. The understanding at first may be largely intellectual, or 'in the head', but you should aim to internalize the knowledge so that it feels true 'in the body'. [cite: These two types of understanding are not so much a scientific claim as one that is experientially helpful. Consider the feeling of being in love versus the thought "I am in love". The thought is an intellectual understanding, whereas the feeling is what we are calling embodied].

Prompts:
- Start logging: Start a pain doc that gathers the evidence about pain in your context and start keeping track of 
- Rubber ducking: Articulate what you think is going on with your pain. What parts are you less sure about? Keep refining until it feels clear in light of the evidence we've presented
- Gather intel: See the evidence page and explore, following your curiosity. Use this to improve your articulation of what's going on.


### 2. Learn to relax the nervous system

As we have discussed, pain is mediated by the state of our nervous system. Just as a strange shadow is far more terrifying right after a scary movie, your bodily sensations are more painful when your sympathetic nervous system is constantly activated.

Settling the nervous system is not unlike entering developer mode on an operating system. From this place of calm we are able to experiment and examine the system in a way that we usually cannot. In many cases, the pain no longer becomes a problem if we are able to deeply settle.

There are many different practices for relaxing the nervous system. This is a domain that is poorly theorized and so it is helpful to experiment.



### 3. Address technical debt

Pain is deeply intertwined with our emotional response. Addressing technical debt in this case means facing the emotional problems we don't want to address.

One of the more powerful practices is to use Somatic Tracking — a technique from Pain Reprocessing Therapy where you pay attention to the pain sensations in a nonjudgmental way.

Consider working with a coach or therapist. There are a small number

### 4. Learn to remain settled in life

The prior skills are helpfully done in a controlled environment, but eventually you have to face the world. This may well include the factors that trigger the pain-generating feedback loop in the first place. It is in our experience very helpful to add challenges

Gentle movement with attention in our experience is very helpful here.

You do not need all of these skills to resolve pain. Many people find significant resolution from education alone [one guy reported big change just from reading the comments section of a book]. But in my experience gaining facility in all these skills significantly increases agency in life and often coincides with the resolution of pain.

*For those who'd enjoy more structure*
We are putting together a free self-guided set of videos. All you have to do is fill out a questionnaire and we can walk you through a prototype to begin.

There are many guides to pain and many different practices for resolving pain. We have experimented with many of these and referred to what we feel are the most compelling for a wide range of people. We invite you also to explore and let us know what you find!
