# **Open Lab hours**

Lab hours are a container for different experiments we want to run related pain. One session might be exploring a new theory of how awareness modulates pain. Another might be a new movement game we want to test! 

We will let you know about our next event via [our newsletter](https://landing.processing-pain.com/sign_up).
