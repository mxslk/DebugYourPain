# **Open Lab hours**

Lab hours are a container for different experiments we want to run related pain. One session might be exploring a new theory of how awareness modulates pain. Another might be a new movement game we want to test. 

Our next open lab will be October 24th at 3pm EST. Join [here](https://mit.zoom.us/j/91884526647).
