# Events

---

Each month, we run events exploring the new ideas and techniques related to the science and practice of resolving pain. They range from live workshops to 4 week guided cohorts.

### **Lab hours**

Lab hours are a container for different experiments we want to run related pain. One session might be exploring a new theory of how awareness modulates pain. Another might be a new movement game we want to test. 

Our next open lab will be October 24th at 3pm EST. We will post details here and also via [our newsletter](https://landing.processing-pain.com/sign_up). 


### **Join a cohort**

We don't offer 1:1 coaching, but anyone interested in working with us should consider joining a Processing Pain cohort. We have a dense 4 week program that embodies all the ideas in our Pain Debugging Protocol. We can't directly refactor your code, but we can use our deep knowledge across the stack to show you how.
