# Principles of Pain
---
*This page concisely outlines contextual information on how pain works. It does so primarily from the perspectives of computational cognitive science and evolutionary biology.*

## Pain is not a measure of damage

Most of us naively equate pain with tissue damage. The most common view is that pain is the body's perception of damage.
{{< katex display=true >}} \text{Tissue damage} \rightarrow \text{Pain receptors fire} \rightarrow \text{Experience of pain} {{< /katex >}}
{{< katex display=true >}} \text{or} {{< /katex >}}
{{< katex display=true >}} \text{Tissue damage} \implies \text{Pain} {{< /katex >}}

This is why if you go into a doctor's office reporting back pain, your spine will often be imaged  for abnormalities (e.g. herniated disk or spinal stenosis)[^1]. They can then attempt try to fix these abnormalities via surgery or, failing that, give you painkillers to manage the pain.

Unfortunately, this model is too simple. Pain does not strictly imply damage:

**Many people have damage without pain.**
Most pain-free people have spinal, hip, shoulder, and knee abnormalities.

In a famous 1994 study, MC Jensen et al. examined the MRI images of the backs of 98 pain-free people. Of the participants, aged twenty and older, *over half had an abnormality ("damage") in at least one disk*[^2]. Herniation or disk bulges were strikingly common in patients who were pain free. There are many other studies demonstrating the frequency of the “spinal abnormalities” that are often used to explain back pain.


Studies have demonstrated similar findings for labral tears in hips, scarred rotator cuffs, knees without cartilage. Repeatedly we have seen people with major structural musculoskeletal damage be entirely pain free. 
- 96% of athletes younger than 22 will show changes on
an MRI that some people call “abnormal”. But since
everyone has them how “abnormal” can they be?
(Rajaswaran 2014)
• 37% of 20 year olds with NO PAIN have disc
degeneration in their spine (Brinjikji 2015)
• 57% of 20-50 year olds with no hip pain will have
cartilidge and ligament tears (Tresch 2016)


**Many people have pain without damage.**

People without limbs report major pain in the limb that is missing



In other words: the typical mistake is to treat pain as purely a hardware problem. What is now very clear is that it is also a software problem.

## Pain is a generated signal for protective action

*How did pain evolve?*

The first pain circuit evolved 600 million years ago, in our ancestor — the bilateral worm. It was a protective instinct responding to external stimuli. If poked, the worm would retreat. 

There were no feelings of unpleasant pain, only instinctive movement. Only far later, as our limbic system developed, did internal sensations like fear and pain arise. The unpleasantness we associate with pain is a later evolutionary module. 

**The purpose of pain is to get you to act**.

If you're cooking later today, and accidently touch a burning stove. What do you do? You whip your hand away from the stove. You might cool it down under running water, and then you'll keep it close to your body. These are all protective actions.

All this is to say that, rather than a measure of damage, pain is a signal your body generates as a prompt to "move to safety". 

*How is pain generated?*

As with all signals that our body generates, it is heavily informed by past experience. 

You can naively think about our experience as an integration of sensory stimuli and our expectations.

## Most chronic pain arises from a miscalibrated pain signal 


- We know that pain response is significantly mediated by many environmental cues. It is also heavily mediated by the state of our nervous system. Consistent stress and sympathetic activation can 

- Pain is only weakly correlated with damage

- We also have strong evidence that a majority of patients reporting chronic pain do not have identifiable structural damage.

- Then it is highly plausible that a large fraction

- Indeed we now do have clear evidence that guided practices can permanently resolve many cases of chronic pain. One way of understanding this is that the pain response is becoming recalibrated to the norm

- For a detailed personal example, see Debugging RSI

2023 study found that, of the 222 patients reporting pain in their back or neck, 88% had no identifiable tissue damage. (Schubiner, Howard, et al. "Application of a Clinical Approach to Diagnosing Primary Pain: Prevalence and Correlates of Primary Back and Neck Pain in a Community Physiatry Clinic." The Journal of Pain 25.3 (2024): 672-681.)

## You can change your pain response

- The brain is highly plastic and capable of significant change.

- It is certainly well within the realms of what humans can do. Extraordinary individuals demonstrate existence proof of training and modification. 

- There are both randomized controlled trials and thousands of anecdotes demonstrating that lasting change in pain response is through a procedure is possible. See the Evidence Page for more.

Unless you are lucky enough to get clinic who are up to date on the contemporary neuroscience of pain. In my personal experience, even at the medical department of my elite university, my doctor was not able to explain what was happening with my pain. Many other people I work with have had the same experience. This is a sad reflection on the feedback loops in the western medical system. New research takes a long time to diffuse into the world. The median you'll come across in 2024 finished their training in the late 90s. There is only so much learning a working doctor has time for in their work.
