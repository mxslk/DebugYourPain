# About

Hi, I'm Max Shen, the creator of DebugYourPain.org.

I built this site because it took me hundreds of hours of careful searching to find the information that helped me resolve my chronic pain. This site is what I wish I had at the start of my experience with pain. 

I've got two degrees from MIT and have worked at both [Moral Psychology Research Lab](https://cushmanlab.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard, and the [Computational Cognitive Science Lab](https://cocosci.mit.edu/) at MIT. After experiencing extensive chronic pain during my graduate program, my focus shifted to understanding and ultimately resolving my pain.

Now, as a pain researcher, I try to articulate the dynamics of pain using everything ranging from active inference to phenomenological interviews. As a practitioner, I use this knowledge to create self-guided practices that aim to bring lasting relief from chronic pain. 

I'm trained in Pain Reprocessing Therapy, a modality using awareness to recalibrate the nervous system, and care deeply about equipping people with the skills and knowledge to relieve themselves from pain.

I built this site with my friend and colleague [Tanner Holman](https://sites.google.com/view/processingpain/talk-to-tanner?pli=1), whose deep knowledge of physiology and movement complements my own technical perspective.

If you would like help 

You can email me at maxkshen[at]gmail[dot]com.
