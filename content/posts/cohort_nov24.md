### Why This Works
Most pain treatment follows a mechanical model: find the "broken" part and fix it. But modern neuroscience reveals that chronic pain is more like a software bug than a hardware problem - it's often a miscalibrated prediction system, not tissue damage.

Key research backing this approach:

- Ashar et al. (2022) demonstrated 67% recovery rate in chronic back pain patients after 4 weeks
- Our pilot sessions have shown similar results across various pain conditions (RSI, chronic back pain, neck pain)
- Built on established principles of the neuroscience of pain, predictive processing, and evolutionary biology


### How It Works

**Format**
- 9 live sessions (3x week 1, 2x weeks 2-4)
- Daily guided practice materials
- 1:1 support as needed
- Small cohort (max 9 participants)

**Content**
- Understanding: Map your pain patterns using tools from systems thinking and neuroscience
- Processing: Evidence-based techniques for recalibrating pain responses
- Integration: Practical strategies for maintaining progress under real-world conditions

## **Prerequisites**

- [Suggested] You are familiar with our [Principles of Pain]({{< relref "/docs/main_posts/understand/principles_of_pain.md" >}}) and are intrigued by the [Pain Debugging Protocol]({{< relref "/docs/main_posts/practice/pillars_of_practice.md" >}}) and would like a more structured experience. 

- You are grappling with wrist pain, backaches, or some form of persistent pain.

- You are willing to put aside 1 hour per day for a month

### Who are you?

{{< figure src="/images/max_portrait.jpeg" alt="drawing" width="200" >}}
Hi, I'm Max Shen. After experiencing debilitating RSI during my graduate work at MIT, I spent hundreds of hours researching pain science and eventually developed a systems approach to pain resolution. Now, as a pain researcher and certified Pain Reprocessing Therapy practitioner, I combine computational models with practical techniques to help others debug their chronic pain. My work draws from cognitive science, predictive processing, and direct experience helping dozens recover from persistent pain.

{{< figure src="/images/tanner_portrait.jpg" alt="drawing" width="200" >}}
I'm Tanner Holman, a movement specialist and physiotherapy student who recovered from chronic back pain by approaching it as a whole-system challenge rather than just a mechanical problem. I blend insights from predictive processing theory with innovative movement practices (Fighting Monkey, Feldenkrais) to help people rebuild trust with their bodies. My approach complements Max's technical framework with practical movement strategies for lasting pain relief.



### FAQ

*Q: Pay only for results?*

How it works: 
1. You decide upfront how much you'd happily pay us if our course resulted in your pain significantly decreasing.
2. If we think you're a good fit, we ask you for a small refundable deposit ($60) to confirm your spot. (This signals commitment to us and yourself).
3. At the end of the course, we send you back your deposit. If you feel like your pain significantly decreased, you pay us the amount, otherwise, it's free.

We're confident that this works, and want to put our skin in the game.

Most courses will charge upfront, but fail to deliver to everyone. Once the client has paid, there's less incentive to keep them happy. We think this payment mechanism better aligns us and our clients because i) clients set reasonable prices before knowing the outcome, and ii) we will be paid only if the client is satisfied.


*Q: Why a whole hour per day?*

We are trying to unlearn habits. 1 hour is 4% of a day. We need to use it wisely if we want to lead to lasting shifts. It is important that this hour is not sandwiched between two otherwise busy periods, but that it happens before or after a normal working period.
