### How it works

- Join a supportive cohort to move through a pain debugging protocol 
- Meet 2-3x per week to learn, and practice established techniques for addressing pain
- 1 on 1 guidance from Max or Tanner


The most popular approaches to pain are based on an outdated model of the body as a biomechanical machine. Thereâ€™s a better way of understanding pain. Once we understand pain as a learning signal, not tissue damage, we can broaden the range of techniques available to help.

Ashar et al. (2022) demonstrated that 67% of chronic pain patients can effectively resolve their pain after just four weeks of instruction. We want to recreate and build on their result with a thoughtful social structure.

## **Prerequisites**

- You know the [Principles of Pain]({{< relref "/docs/main_posts/understand/principles_of_pain.md" >}}) and are intrigued by the [Pain Debugging Protocol]({{< relref "/docs/main_posts/practice/pillars_of_practice.md" >}}) and would like a more structured experience. 

- You are grappling with wrist pain, backaches, or some form of persistent pain

- You are willing to put aside 1 hour per day for a month.

More on what to expect:
Nine sessions total (3 in the first week, then 2 each week afterwards). Sessions are all personally led by [Max Shen and Tanner Holman]({{< relref "/docs/main_posts/about.md" >}}). 

The content fluctuates depending on your needs, but the core areas are:

1. Understanding your pain (integrating evolutionary biology and complexity into your biopsychosocial context)

2. Processing patterns (refining interoceptive ability and the skill of internal attunement)

3. Moving into life (using movement games to integrate our processing and learning to live without triggering old patterns)

We have nine spaces and expect these to fill up in the next week. You can register interest [here](https://tally.so/r/3xPeqy).

### FAQ

Note: We will always continue to open source our knowledge and practices. This intensive is about tailoring our knowledge to your situation.

*Q: Why a whole hour per day?*

We are trying to unlearn habits. Most of the practices don't need that much time, but it is important to have space around the practice. It should not be jammed between two meetings.

*Q: Is there a refund policy?*

Refund policy: We can't guarantee pain resolution (no one can), but we predict with high likelihood that your direct experience of pain will change and that you will have a handle on your pain. If you complete the month and don't feel there's been a noticeable shift, we will refund you.
