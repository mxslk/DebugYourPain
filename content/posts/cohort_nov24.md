This might be the most difficult challenge you've ever faced. Everything else â€”Â exams, competitions, assignmentsÂ â€”Â may have folded when you just *tried harder.* Not this. As we laid out in our [debugging protocol]({{< relref "/docs/main_posts/practice/pillars_of_practice.md" >}}), chronic pain does not fold under more force.  Your body is a complex system, not a mechanical machine. Instead of force, we have to observe and experiment with patience.

With this month-long intensive, we'll scaffold your journey through the different foundational skills for debugging pain. Small group sizes mean that you will get support both from us and peers as you begin to untangle and refactor the patterns that contribute to pain.

## **Prerequisites**

- You know the [Principles of Pain]({{< relref "/docs/main_posts/understand/principles_of_pain.md" >}}) and are intrigued by the [Pain Debugging Protocol]({{< relref "/docs/main_posts/practice/pillars_of_practice.md" >}}) and would like a more structured experience. 

- You are grappling with wrist pain, backaches, or some form of persistent pain

- You are willing to put aside 1 hour per day for a month.

More on what to expect:
Eight sessions total (2 per week). Sessions are all personally led by [Max Shen and Tanner Holman]({{< relref "/docs/main_posts/about.md" >}}). 

The content fluctuates depending on your needs, but the core areas are:

1. Understanding your pain (integrating evolutionary biology and complexity into your biopsychosocial context)

2. Processing patterns (refining interoceptive ability and the skill of internal attunement)

3. Moving into life (using movement games to integrate our processing and learning to live without triggering old patterns)


We have nine spaces and expect these to fill up in the next week. You can register interest here.

Note: We will always continue to open source our knowledge and practices. This intensive is about tailoring our knowledge to your situation.

Refund policy: We can't guarantee pain resolution (no one can), but we predict with high likelihood that your direct experience of pain will change and that you will have a handle on your pain. If you complete the month and don't feel there's been a noticeable shift, we will refund you.
