### How it works

- Join a supportive cohort to move through a pain debugging protocol 
- Meet 2-3x per week to learn, and practice established techniques for addressing pain
- 1 on 1 guidance from Max or Tanner


The most popular approaches to pain are based on an outdated model of the body as a biomechanical machine. Thereâ€™s a better way of understanding pain. Once we understand pain as a learning signal, not tissue damage, we can broaden the range of techniques available to help.

Ashar et al. (2022) demonstrated that 67% of chronic pain patients can effectively resolve their pain after just four weeks of instruction. We want to recreate and build on their result with a thoughtful social structure.

## **Prerequisites**

- You know the [Principles of Pain]({{< relref "/docs/main_posts/understand/principles_of_pain.md" >}}) and are intrigued by the [Pain Debugging Protocol]({{< relref "/docs/main_posts/practice/pillars_of_practice.md" >}}) and would like a more structured experience. 

- You are grappling with wrist pain, backaches, or some form of persistent pain

- You are willing to put aside 1 hour per day for a month.

Here's what Cam says about going through our process:
{{< youtube MC7A5CM5w6Y >}}

More on what to expect:
Nine sessions total (3 in the first week, then 2 each week afterwards). Sessions are all personally led by [Max Shen and Tanner Holman]({{< relref "/docs/main_posts/about.md" >}}). 

The content fluctuates depending on your needs, but the core areas are:

1. Understanding your pain (integrating evolutionary biology and complexity into your biopsychosocial context)

2. Processing patterns (refining interoceptive ability and the skill of internal attunement)

3. Moving into life (using movement games to integrate our processing and learning to live without triggering old patterns)

We have nine spaces and expect these to fill up in the next week. You can register interest [here](https://tally.so/r/3xPeqy).

### FAQ

*Q: Pay only for results?*

How it works: 
1. You decide upfront how much you'd happily pay us if our course resulted in your pain significantly decreasing.
2. If we think you're a good fit, we ask you for a small refundable deposit ($60) to confirm your spot. (This signals commitment to us and yourself).
3. At the end of the course, we send you back your deposit. If you feel like your pain significantly decreased, you pay us the amount, otherwise, it's free.

We're confident that this works, and want to put our skin in the game.

Most courses will charge upfront, but fail to deliver to everyone. Once the client has paid, there's less incentive to keep them happy. We think this payment mechanism better aligns us and our clients because i) clients set reasonable prices before knowing the outcome, and ii) we will be paid only if the client is satisfied.


*Q: Why a whole hour per day?*

We are trying to unlearn habits. 1 hour is 4% of a day. We need to use it wisely if we want to lead to lasting shifts. It is important that this hour is not sandwiched between two otherwise busy periods, but that it happens before or after a normal working period.
