# Debugging pain is a skill you can learn

I spent a thousand hours experimenting with how to resolve chronic pain. I succeeded and began to teach other people. This site condenses hundreds of hours of trying different techniques, dozens of pain science papers, and the workshops I've run.

**You can go from in pain and frustrated to having a clear path forward. Here's how:**

## 1. Understand the principles of pain

Pain is not damage. It is a signal for protective action. Grasping a more accurate model of pain is the first step towards resolution.

## 2. Practice debugging pain

Like untangling a codebase, debugging pain well requires a set of skills. You can learn these.

## 3. Find support

Other people can provide helpful support in this process.

To hear about workshops and new resources, [join the mailing list](https://landing.processing-pain.com/sign_up) or check out our [events]({{< relref "/docs/main_posts/events/lab_hours.md" >}}).

We are also running an experimental [pain debugging intensive]({{< relref "/posts/cohort_nov24.md" >}}) in November 2024.
