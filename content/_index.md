# Debugging pain is a skill you can learn

I spent a thousand hours experimenting with how to resolve chronic pain. I succeeded and began to teach other people. This site condenses hundreds of hours of trying different techniques, dozens of pain science papers, and the workshops I've run.

**You can go from in pain and frustrated to having a clear path forward. Here's how:**

## 1. Understand the principles of pain

Pain is not damage. It is a signal for protective action. Grasping a more accurate model of pain is the first step towards resolution.

**Short summary: [Principles of Pain]({{< relref "/docs/main_posts/understand/principles_of_pain.md" >}})**

**Just give me the evidence please: [Evidence Page]({{< relref "/docs/main_posts/understand/evidence.md" >}})**



## 2. Practice debugging pain

Like untangling a codebase, debugging pain well requires a set of skills. You can learn these.


**Do it yourself with the [Pain Debugging Protocol]({{< relref "/docs/main_posts/practice/pillars_of_practice.md" >}})**. If you'd like support, [we can also help](https://www.debugyourpain.org/docs/main_posts/about/).
